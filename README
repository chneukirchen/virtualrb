= virtualrb - Virtualize Ruby installations

THIS IS ALPHA SOFTWARE THAT HAS NOT BEEN TESTED WELL---USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

Idea inspired by Python's virtualenv: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv

Usage:  ruby virtualrb.rb ROOT
          to set up a new virtual Ruby in ROOT/bin/ruby
        ruby virtualrb.rb ROOT /usr/bin/ruby-1.8.4
          to set up a new virtual Ruby using the given interpreter
          (default: version that calls virtualrb.rb.)

If you use a sh(1)-compatible shell, you can enter the virtualized setup with:
  source ROOT/bin/activate
and leave it again with
  deactivate

What works:
* Plain Ruby libraries.
* Ruby apps with correct she-bang line, pointing to the virtualized Ruby.
* Installing Rubygems, including building native extensions.
* Only tested on OS X so far.

What won't work:
* Too clever software.  Especially it must not modify $archdir.

How it works:
* We build a modified rbconfig and build a wrapper script for Ruby
  to call it with appropriate $RUBYLIB and $RUBYPATH.

To do:
* Build scripts to automatically install Rubygems, dependencies,
  software from source control.
* Dynamic relocation (no hard-coded paths).
